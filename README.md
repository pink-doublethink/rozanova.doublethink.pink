### What is the project about?
---
- The project was created in order to create a blog about the importance of developing a blog about emotional intelligence. When creating the blog, I used and studied the UI component libraries Ant Design and Material UI. 

- The information in the project is the result of personal searches of literature and practices to develop the ability to analyze one's emotions in order to better understand oneself and others.
